# Rush Hour Solver

It is a solver of a sliding block puzzle [Rush Hour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_Hour_(puzzle)) implemented in C++ with fltk. This project is the second project of SJTU 2023 Fall Course CS2309.

## To do:

rowCnt & colCnt is unnecessary to store in every bitBoard but just in the whole Solver as they never change

add a label to show the step taken

add a feature that the user can move the bars in the board to try to solve the puzzle
